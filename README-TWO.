# Assignment 6

1. Describe the difference between asynchronous programming with synchronous programming

Synchronous programming refers to the interaction between a client and server that are interdependent. This means that a server waits until a client makes a request before working on a response, and a client waits for the response before making a new request. However, with asynchronous progamming, no waiting is needed. A client can make a request and continue to do more work while waiting for the response.


2. When implementing Javascript and AJAX, there is an application in the paradigms of Event-Driven Programming. Describe the reasoning for those paradigms and state some examples of its application.

Event-driven programming refers to the running of a program when an event occurs. In this case, the event would be when the user submits information for a new task for the to-do list. As a result, this "event" triggers code for AJAX POST, which receives the information, formats it, then redisplays it.


3. Describe the implementation of asynchronous programming in AJAX.

AJAX, on its own, is already able to send and retrieve data from servers asynchronously ([source](https://www.nerd.vision/post/ajax-the-asynchronous-programming-paradigm-for-the-asynchronous-mind)). This means that no refreshing is required when changes occur.


4. Explain how you would implement the checklist above.

First, add javascript and jquery scripts in base.html, then add the javascript code in the required HTML file. I also created a new function to display all the todolist data in json form. Using .get(), retrieve the data from the json file, and add the corresponding HTML formatting. Then, display it.
